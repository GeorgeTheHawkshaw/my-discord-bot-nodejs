Feel free to let me know what problems you encounter by opening an issue on the repo.\r\nThis was originally an update of the original bot from [ruiqimao](https://github.com/ruiqimao/discord.js-music) by [nexu-dev](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord.js-music-v11), but is now a updated version for [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/)'s version 11.2^. Fixes deprecated warnings, video playback issues, along with various other add-ons and tweaks to the priors.  \r\n\r\n_Note: the 1.3.x+ update(S) requires a code change from 1.2.0, see the examples/notes below._  \r\n_Some commands/features of the bot require to be able to embed links in messages to work correctly since update 1.6.10+._  \r\n\r\n__The commands available are: (default names)__  \r\n* `musichelp [command]`: Displays help text for commands by this addon, or help for a specific command.\r\n* `play <url>|<search string>`: Play audio from YouTube.\r\n* `skip [number]`: Skip a song or multi songs with skip [some number],\r\n* `queue`: Display the current queue.\r\n* `pause`: Pause music playback. (requires music manager).\r\n* `resume`: Resume music playback. (requires music manager).\r\n* `volume`: Adjust the playback volume between 1 and 200 (requires music manager).\r\n* `leave`: Clears the song queue and leaves the channel.\r\n* `clearqueue`: Clears the song queue.\r\n\r\n__Permissions:__  \r\n* If `anyoneCanSkip` is false then only admins and the user that requested the song can skip it.\r\n* If `anyoneCanAdjust` is true, anyone can adjust the volume. False is only admins.\r\n* If `ownerOverMember` is true, the set ID of the user (your ID) will over-ride CanAjust and CanSkip.\r\n\r\n***\r\n# Installation\r\n***  \r\n__Pre-installation:__  \r\n1. `npm install discord.js`  \r\nIt is recommended to have the stable over dev branch.  \r\n\r\n2. `ffmpeg installed` and in your PATH.  \r\nAllows the bot to join voice as well as speak.\r\n* Download the ffmpeg package for your system.\r\n* Extract it to the proper place.\r\n* Set it to your PATH environment variables.\r\n\r\n3. `npm install node-opus` or `npm install opusscript`  \r\nRequired for voice. Discord.js _prefers_ node-opus, but it is your choice.\r\n\r\n__Installation:__  \r\n* `npm install discord.js-musicbot-addon`\r\n\r\n__Common installation issues:__  \r\n__Issue: (Rare)__ FFMPEG was not found on your system.  \r\n__Fix:__ Make sure ffmpeg is installed correctly and set in your PATH variable.  \r\n\r\n__Issue: (Uncommon)__ Couldn't find an Opus engine.  \r\n__Fix:__ `npm install node-opus` or `npm install opusscript`  \r\n\r\n__Issue: (Rare)__ [NPM] ERR Cannot read property '0' of undefined  \r\n__Fix:__ `npm i -g npm@4.6.1` or another lower version of npm.  \r\n\r\n__Issue: (Uncommon)__ TypeError: Invalid non-string/buffer chunk  \r\n__Fix:__ `ffmpeg` is required, if you installed `ffmpeg-binaries` uninstall that and install `ffmpeg`. If that isn't your problem make sure you have it installed correctly.  \r\n\r\n__Issue: (Trivial)__ Any node-gyp errors. (build fail, missing cl.exe, etc.)  \r\n__Fix:__ This one is a little more complicated.  \r\n1. Download and install [Visual Studio 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/)  \r\n2. New project -> Visual C++  \r\n3. Install Visual C++  \r\n\r\nIf that doesn't fix your issue;  \r\n1. Download and install the [Windows 8.1 SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-8-1-sdk)  \r\n\r\n__Issue: (Uncommon)__ `ffluent-ffmpeg` errors.\r\n1. Download and install ffmpeg correctly for your OS.\r\n2. Make sure it's in your PATH/exported.  \r\n\r\n***\r\n# Examples & Options\r\n***  \r\nThis addon is easy to use, and doesn't require any configuration.  \r\nMore examples can be found on the repo in `examples` or once downloaded.  \r\n\r\n__Example basic code, standalone:__\r\n```javascript\r\nconst Discord = require('discord.js');\r\nconst Music = require('discord.js-musicbot-addon');\r\nconst client = new Discord.Client();\r\n\r\nconst music = new Music(client, {\r\n  youtubeKey: 'sum-key_hhereas'\r\n});\r\n\r\nclient.login(token);\r\n```\r\n\r\n__Most options are optional and thus not needed.__  \r\nThe options you can pass in `music(client, {options})` and their types is as followed:  \r\n_Note: All boolean options default false._  \r\n\r\n| Option | Type | Description |  \r\n| --- | --- | --- |  \r\n| youtubeKey | *Required* string | A YouTube API3 key. |\r\n| botPrefix | String | The prefix of the bot.
